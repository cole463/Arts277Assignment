        <h1> What is Lorem Ipsum? </h1>
        <b> Lorem Ipsum </b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the <br>
        industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and <br>
        scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into <br>
        electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of <br>
        Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like <br>
       <b><i><u> Aldus PageMaker </u></i></b> including versions of Lorem Ipsum.  <strong> 1914 translation by H. Rackham </strong

        <blockquote> But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain <br>
         was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the <br>
        great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or <br>
        avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue <br>
        pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone <br>
        who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally <br>
        circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure

        <h1> Why do we use it? </h1>
        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its <br>
        layout. The point of using <u> Lorem Ipsum </u> is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to <br>
        using “Content here, content here”, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and <br>
        web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for “lorem Ipsum” will uncover <br>
        many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, <br>
        sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

        <h2> Where can I get some?</h2>
        <b>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered <br>
        alteration in some form, by injected humour, or <u>randomized words </u> which don't look even slightly <br>
        believable.</b> If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything <br>
        embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. <i> All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat <br>
        predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.</i> It uses a dictionary of over <br>
        200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks <br>
        reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, <br>
        or noncharacteristic words etc.
